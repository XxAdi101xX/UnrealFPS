# UnrealFPS
UnrealFPS is a first person shooter game with teleportation portals built on Unreal Engine 4 and was inspired by the game Splitgate.
## Features
- Portals that can be placed throughout the world and provides a viewport into the destination and can be entered to teleport an entity (player character, bullet, enemy characters etc.) to its counterpart portal. The portals are one-way and thus are neither visible or accessible from the "opposite" side and only teleports entities that enter from the correct side.

- A core FPS gameplay loop that supports shooting of damaging projectiles, enemy characters that have a field of vision that chase any players within a certain radius and damage when in melee range

## Build
This project was build on Unreal Engine 4.27.2 and can be run on eithers Windows or MacOS. A machine with an external GPU is recommended for maximum performance.
